Module 2: Git and Bash

1) What is Git and how is it different from Github

Git is the most popular version of version control, which is a way to manage code. It works its benefits are similar to those of Google documents. It allows for collaborations on code to be done. Github is a place online where people can host their Git Repositories. There are other platforms that do the same such as BitBucket and GitLab. As mentioned in the Module 2 file, Git is the actual version control tool. 


2) Why use the terminal?
It is more efficient to use the terminal. Once you become used to operating the terminal, one can work faster in it. 

3) 3 benefits of version control in your own words.

 1. It allows people to collaborate and work on code together. Everyone can access the code at a central location. 

2. With version control we can keep track of changes done to our code over time and by whom. 

3. If for whatever reason the group needs track back, version control allows us to revert our code back to its original state.
